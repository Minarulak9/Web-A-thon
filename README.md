# Web-A-thon

This is a project which we were given in IIT Kharagpur

What is the problem statement

Problem statement :
Your friend is participating in a hackathon named "Smartathon" and needs to form a team from his college but
he is unable to find a partner or form a team for the same. You decide to make a full stack application to address
this issue.
● You need to make a web app where people can post the name of any competition and the number of
Team members required along with the details of the competition.
● After it is posted, it will be visible to the other members who will open the portal.
● If any user is interested in any posted competition, he can send a request to join the team.
● Names of all the people who sent a request ( to join the team for that competition ) will be visible to the
person who posted about it and he can accept or reject people. Once the number of people required is
met, the post will vanish from the portal's dashboard and the details of the people whom he had selected
will be visible to the person who had posted it.
Key points:
● Logic plays the most important part, make sure your backend logic is robust and try to consider any edge
cases if any.
● A good UI always plays an important role and increases the traffic enormously..
Judging criteria:
❖ You are allowed to innovate in each component. Show your creativity in additional functionalities to
enhance user experience.
❖ Your site must have at least 2 screens:
➢ Portal homepage where one can post about the competition along with the required number of
members. Along with that he/she can see the people who have requested to join his/her team if
he/she had posted for any competition. There will be a drop down at the top of this page to
toggle between the users.
➢ User creation dashboard where we can create new users with basic minimalistic details as input.
❖ You are allowed to make multiple screens and design your website in a better way. We will be evaluating
continuously based on your strategy, execution, timing, collaboration etc. Make sure one of your team
members is always present in the venue while the hackathon is ongoing, this will facilitate us to take
reports on timely progress.
❖ It is compulsory to use mongoDB as a database. We will be focusing on correctness and user
experience.
Bonus Points for the following implementation:
● The person willing to join the team can send personalized messages with the request.
● Once the positions are filled, the posts for those positions get removed from the site portal in real time
using socket.io
